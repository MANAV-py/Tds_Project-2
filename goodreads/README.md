## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of a dataset related to books, which includes various characteristics and ratings associated with them. The analysis explores the data's summary statistics, missing values, outliers, and visualizations to provide insights into the relationships and patterns within the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information on 10,000 books. It includes attributes such as unique IDs, ratings, authors, publication year, and various ratings distributions (1 to 5 star ratings).

## Summary Statistics
The summary statistics of the dataset reveal the following:

- **book_id**: Ranges from 1 to 10,000 with a mean of 5000.5.
- **goodreads_book_id** and **best_book_id**: Have large ranges (from 1 to over 33 million), indicating a diverse set of books.
- **average_rating**: The mean rating is 4.03, suggesting that most books are received positively.
- **ratings_count**: An extensive range from 323 to 793,319, indicating that some books are much more popular than others.

### Key Statistics
| Measure              | Count (n=10,000) | Mean      | Std Dev   | Min       | Max       |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| average_rating      | 10,000           | 4.03      | 0.56      | 0.12      | 5.00      |
| ratings_count       | 10,000           | 11,958    | 28,546    | 323       | 793,319   |

## Missing Values
The dataset has several columns with missing values. Key columns with missing data include:
- **isbn** (700 missing)
- **isbn13** (585 missing)
- **original_publication_year** (21 missing)
- **original_title** (585 missing)
- **language_code** (1,084 missing)

### Summary of Missing Values
| Column                           | Missing Values |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| isbn                             | 700            |
| isbn13                           | 585            |
| original_publication_year       | 21             |
| original_title                  | 585            |
| language_code                   | 1,084          |

## Outlier Analysis
Outliers have been detected across several columns, particularly in ratings:
- **average_rating**: 151 outliers detected.
- **ratings_count**: 1,095 outliers detected.

### Summary of Outliers
| Column                          | Outliers        |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| average_rating                  | 151             |
| ratings_count                   | 1,095           |
| work_ratings_count              | 1,089           |

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were generated to help interpret the dataset:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**: This visual representation shows the relationship between different numerical features in the dataset.

2. **Pairplot**: A pairwise scatter plot to visualize distributions and relationships among features.

3. **Regression Plot**: A regression plot that examines the relationship between average ratings and the number of ratings.

4. **Histograms**: Histograms for each numeric column to illustrate the distribution of values across features.

5. **KMeans Clustering**: Based on the features, KMeans clustering was applied to categorize the books. The clustered data is saved as [clustered_data.csv](./clustered_data.csv).

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that most books in this dataset enjoy positive ratings, though there are significant differences in popularity and potentially in the quality of reviews. Attention should be paid to the missing values and outliers that may affect insights or modeling based on this data. The visualizations provide a clear summary of relationships within the dataset and can be useful in guiding further analysis or predictive modeling.

## Next Steps
1. Address missing values through appropriate imputation methods.
2. Investigate the impact of outliers on analysis.
3. Conduct further exploratory analyses on specific clusters of books identified in the KMeans clustering.
4. Explore potential predictive modeling to assess factors that lead to higher ratings or increased popularity.
